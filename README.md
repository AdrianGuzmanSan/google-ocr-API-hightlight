# Google OCR detection highlight in NodeJS
This code uses the node canvas package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) <br />
and the image size package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-size) <br />
to highlight the word matches given in the resulting JSON from the Google Cloud OCR API (https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr) and also to numerate the matches so you can check its order.
